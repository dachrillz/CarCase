# CAR CASE!

# Requirements
    1. To run this locally you need bash, Python3, pip3, virtualenv and postgresql installed. 

# Install
    1. In theory one only needs to run ./install.sh inside the /scripts/ folder

# Deployed version
    1. With a high likelihood there will be problems running this software locally, since that is how software generally
    works today. Therefore this code is also deployed on the following ip address: 165.227.169.249
    2. This way one only needs a web browser to access the website.
